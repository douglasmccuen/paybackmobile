				<h3>General questions about Payback Mobile</h3>
				<dl class="lead">
				
					<dt>Are all offers in the book on the app?</dt>
					<dd>The majority of the offers are in the app.  
						Some merchants are new to mobile marketing, and are taking some time to evaluate their advertising plans 
						before committing to Payback Mobile.
						However, unlike the paper Payback coupon book, which cannot be added to after its printed, with Payback Mobile 
						we will be adding new merchants thoughout the year!
					</dd>
				
					<dt>When we buy the book do we get the app for free?</dt>
					<dd>No.  Each product sells separately for $20.</dd>
				
					<dt>I don't have any affiliation with a school or group and don't have a child in a school.  How do I simply buy Payback Mobile?</dt>
					<dd>
						Just download the Talool app from the App Store or Google Play.  After you have registered your account, you can select Find Deals to
						start your purchase of Payback Mobile.
					</dd>
				
					<dt>How do I share my Payback Mobile offers with my friends?</dt>
					<dd>
						Sharing works just like sending a gift; we move a coupon out your account and make it available for anyone else you specify.  
						You can specify who will receive your gift by opening a deal in the Talool app and selecting the Give As Gift button.  
						Your gift is sent as soon as you select an email address from your phone (or a Facebook friend if you signed in with Facebook).
						The person you pick will receive an email telling them about your gift.
					</dd>
				
					<dt>Is there a customer service contact for Talool if I get stuck using the app?</dt>
					<dd>Absolutely!  Please contact <a href="mailto:support@talool.com">support@talool.com</a> if you have any trouble.</dd>

				<h2>Questions about fundraising with Payback Mobile</h2>
				<dl class="lead">
					<dt>How does the school and my student get credit for app purchases?</dt>
					<dd>
						We give our fundraisers a simple way to create tracking codes that allow us to credit them for purchases in the Talool app.  
						The tracking codes must be entered in the Talool app at the time of purchase to ensure both you and your school will get credit for your sale.
						<br/><br/>
						To get a tracking code, just go to <a href="/m/">our home page</a> and select your location at the bottom of the page to start the 
						Fundraiser Registration process.  You will be sent to Talool.com to create a tracking code for you school or orgainization that will 
						be associated with any name and email you provide.  You can generate as many tracking codes as you want (e.g. one for each of your children).
						<br/><br/>
						Each school (or team/club) is provided with a unique web page that shows all the sales for each of the tracking codes that been created by their 
						parents/students/members.  In addition, you can see the sales credited to any tracking code by going to the Talool 
						<a href="http://talool.com/m/tracking">sales tracker</a>.  Schools (or teams/clubs) can use this information to award prizes for your sales.
					</dd>
				
					<dt>How do I inform others to buy Payback Mobile on the Talool app?</dt>
					<dd>
						When you follow the Fundraiser Registration instructions above, you will get an email that will help you sell Payback Mobile on the Talool app.
						You can simply forward that email to your friends and family, so they have all the information they need (including your tracking code) to 
						install the Talool app and purchase Payback Mobile.
					</dd>
				
					<dt>How much money does my school or group make when I buy Payback Mobile on the Talool app?</dt>
					<dd>
						Just like with the Payback Book, schools and non profit groups make 50% profit on every Payback Mobile download 
						that is credited to their account through the use of the unique code assigned to them.
					</dd>
