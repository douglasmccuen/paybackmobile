The first Payback Book launched in Vancouver, Wash in 2001, followed by Boulder County, Colorado in 2009 and Bend/Central Oregon in 2014.

Schools and groups receive a generous 50% profit on all Payback Book/Mobile Apps they sell.   Merchants benefit through the extensive "word of mouth" network that Payback helps foster through its introductory discounts.    Local families benefit by discovering new merchants NEAR home, and becoming loyal, regular customers.
